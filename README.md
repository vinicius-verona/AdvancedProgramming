# Programming Contests Challenges

- This repository contains the development for challenges proposed as part of the course `Advanced Programming and Algorithms`.
- Each algorithm is developed in `C` language, and it is submitted to [OnlineJudge](https://onlinejudge.org/).
- Each challenge can also be found in the [Programming Challenges](https://www.amazon.com.br/dp/B008AFF2ZU/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1) book, by Steven S. Skiena and Miguel A. Revilla.
